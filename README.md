# cp_license_troubleshooter

This script will run through some basic checks showing what issues may effect the 
cPanel license from updating. 

We have an internal wiki on items to check when a customer experiences licensing issues.
These checks are automated based off of the wiki and should give you hopefully enough
information on what the cause may be.
